He is the co-founder of Gruntwork, a company that provides DevOps as a Service. He's also the author of two books published by O'Reilly Media: Hello, Startup and Terraform: Up & Running. Previously, he spent more than a decade building infrastructure and products that served hundreds of millions of users while working as a software engineer at LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Cisco Systems, and Thomson Financial.
